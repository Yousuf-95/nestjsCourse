# Services and Repositories
<br/>

**Repositories:** Repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer.

**Services:** Services is a class that uses one or more repositories to find or store data.

## Inversion of Control Principle:

> Bad way to write code according to inversion of control principle:
```TS
export class MessagesService {
  messagesRepo: MessagesRepository;
  constructor() {
    // DONT DO THIS IN REAL APP. Use dependency injection instead.
    this.messagesRepo = new MessagesRepository();
  }
}
```

> Better Way to write the above code:
```TS
export class MessagesService {
    messagesRepo: MessagesRepository;

    constructor(messagesRepo: MessagesRepository) {
        this.messagesRepo = messagesRepo;
    }
}
```

> Best way to write above code
```TS
interface Repository {
  findOne(id: string);
  findAll();
  create(content: string);
}
export class MessagesService {
  messagesRepo: Repository;
  constructor(repo: Repository) {
    this.messagesRepo = repo;
  }
}
```

Why the last case is actually good...
<br>
In the 'better' way to write code, we pass the 'MessagesRepository' itself as the dependency when initializing the class, but in case of 'best' way of writing the code, we just want the repository to have to conform to a specific interface. In this way, we can migrate to a different database if we wanted to, just by plugging in the repository of the new database that conforms to the interface. We can also write different code for the repository for testing and production environments.
